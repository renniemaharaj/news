<BEGIN AXIOMS>

01: Existence of God
We affirm the existence of God. This truth transcends human reasoning and cannot be fully proven or disproven. Our foundation begins here: <strong>God is</strong>.

02: KJV Bible as Truth
The King James Version (KJV) Bible is the complete and authoritative Word of God. Any translation that contradicts the KJV is considered false and must be rejected.

03: <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> as Truth
This third axiom follows logically from the previous two. If <strong>God is</strong>, and the KJV Bible is true, then the KJV Bible's account of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> is also true. External historical sources also confirm the existence of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, but the KJV Bible is our primary source within this framework.
