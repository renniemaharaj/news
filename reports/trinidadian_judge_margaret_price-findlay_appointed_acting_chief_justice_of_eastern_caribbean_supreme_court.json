  "title": "Trinidadian Judge Margaret Price-Findlay Appointed Acting Chief Justice of Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court",
  "summary": "Justice Margaret Price-Findlay, a Trinidadian national, has been appointed as the acting Chief Justice of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, a historic first for someone outside the Eastern Caribbean. This report details her extensive legal career and education. While celebrating professional achievement and leadership qualities is understandable from a worldly perspective, this news focuses solely on secular legal and political systems. It does not intersect with the core axioms concerning the existence of God, the ultimate truth of the KJV Bible, or the salvation offered through Jesus Christ. Matters of earthly justice systems operate separately from God's divine law and judgment.",
