  "title": "Profile of Cardinal Coutts: Interreligious Dialogue and Christian Rights in Pakistan",
  "summary": "This article highlights the work of Catholic Cardinal Joseph Coutts in Pakistan, focusing on his efforts in interreligious dialogue, promoting peace, and defending the rights of the Christian minority. While advocating for peace and protecting Christians from persecution aligns with Christian values of compassion, the report operates within a Catholic framework. This framework includes doctrines and practices distinct from the sole authority of the KJV Bible. The emphasis on interreligious harmony, while well-intentioned for societal peace, must be carefully evaluated against the KJV's mandate to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the exclusive path to salvation (Acts 4:12, Mark 16:15) and avoid unequal yoking with unbelief (2 Corinthians 6:14).",
