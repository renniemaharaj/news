  "title": "Decline in International Tourism to U.S. Linked to Politics and Border Controls",
  "summary": "International tourism to the United States has reportedly seen a significant drop, attributed to current political tensions and stricter border control measures. This trend reflects the impact of national policies and international relations on global travel and economies. From a framework perspective, such events illustrate the complexities and often exclusionary nature of worldly systems, contrasting with the universal call and welcome found in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which transcends earthly borders and political divides (Galatians 3:28, Colossians 3:11). The focus remains on temporal, man-made systems rather than the eternal Kingdom of God.",
