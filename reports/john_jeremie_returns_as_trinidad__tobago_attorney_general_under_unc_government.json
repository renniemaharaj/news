  "title": "John Jeremie Returns as Trinidad \u0026 Tobago Attorney General Under UNC Government",
  "summary": "John Jeremie, SC, previously Attorney General under the PNM, has been sworn in again under the UNC banner led by Kamla Persad-Bissessar. Jeremie expressed concerns about the nation being near 'the brink of disaster,' citing issues like crime, the economy, questionable past conduct, and high government spending on legal fees. While addressing crime and economic stability is crucial for any society, the approach discussed remains rooted in secular politics and legal maneuvering. There is no mention of seeking God's wisdom (Proverbs 2:6), adhering to Biblical principles for governance, or acknowledging Christ as the ultimate authority and solution to societal ills. The focus is on human systems and political power shifts, rather than the foundational truths of our axioms.",
