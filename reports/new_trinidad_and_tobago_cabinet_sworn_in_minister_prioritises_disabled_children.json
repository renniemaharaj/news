  "title": "New Trinidad and Tobago Cabinet Sworn In; Minister Prioritises Disabled Children",
  "summary": "Trinidad and Tobago's new Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, has been sworn in, outlining national priorities. While earthly governments are ordained by God (Romans 13:1 KJV), our ultimate citizenship is in heaven. The new Health Minister's focus on children with disabilities reflects a form of compassion, mirroring Christ's care for the vulnerable (Matthew 25:40 KJV), yet true hope rests not in political systems but in Jesus Christ. Other political and technological news, including discussions on AI, reminds believers to discern worldly events through the lens of God's unchanging Word (KJV) and His eternal plan.",
