  "title": "Political Uncertainty and Rising Costs for International Students in Australia",
  "summary": "The article details the challenges international students face in Australia due to fluctuating government policies, political maneuvering, and significant visa fee increases. This situation highlights the difficulties faced by foreigners seeking opportunities abroad and can be viewed through the lens of Christian ethics regarding the treatment of strangers. The Bible commands believers to treat the stranger with love and fairness (Leviticus 19:34 KJV: \"But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.\"), contrasting with the political scapegoating mentioned in the text.",
