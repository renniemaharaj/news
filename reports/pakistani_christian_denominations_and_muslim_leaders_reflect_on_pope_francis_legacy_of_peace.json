  "title": "Pakistani Christian Denominations and Muslim Leaders Reflect on Pope Francis' Legacy of Peace",
  "summary": "This article details the positive reflections from various Christian denominations (Catholic, Anglican) and Muslim leaders in Pakistan regarding the late Pope Francis' emphasis on peace, empathy, and interfaith brotherhood. While acknowledging the desire for peace, this report highlights a potential divergence from the framework's axioms. The focus on ecumenism (unity between different denominations) and interfaith dialogue based on shared humanity risks diluting the exclusive truth found in the King James Version (KJV) Bible (Axiom 02) and the specific path to salvation through Jesus Christ alone (Axiom 03), as revealed therein. The Catholic Church's reliance on traditions and non-KJV translations fundamentally conflicts with Axiom 02.",
