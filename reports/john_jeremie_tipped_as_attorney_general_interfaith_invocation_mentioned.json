  "title": "John Jeremie Tipped as Attorney General; Interfaith Invocation Mentioned",
  "summary": "Discusses the potential appointment of John Jeremie as Attorney General in the new Trinidad and Tobago government. Significantly, it notes an interfaith musical performance at the Prime Minister's swearing-in ceremony, which reportedly included praise for Jesus Christ alongside Hindu, Islamic, and Orisha deities. While acknowledging Jesus Christ (Axiom 03), the syncretic nature of the event places His name alongside other deities, diverging from the exclusivity of Truth found in the KJV Bible (Axiom 02).",
