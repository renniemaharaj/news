  "title": "Nigerians Reportedly Leaving Christianity for Indigenous Spiritual Practices",
  "summary": "This article details a trend in Nigeria where individuals, particularly youth, are abandoning Christian churches for traditional African beliefs, citing disillusionment and a desire to connect with ancestral spirituality. These practices, including divination and ancestor veneration, starkly contrast with the teachings of the KJV Bible, which warns against such syncretism and idolatry (Deuteronomy 18:10-12, Leviticus 19:31, Isaiah 8:19, 2 Corinthians 6:14-17). While acknowledging potential failings within some churches, the solution presented (embracing Indigenous spirituality) leads away from the truth found only in Jesus Christ (John 14:6). This trend represents a spiritual danger, turning from God's Word to other beliefs.",
