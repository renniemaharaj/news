  "title": "Report Suggests 'Quiet Revival' in Great Britain, Urges Christian Readiness",
  "summary": "The article highlights encouraging signs of increased church attendance and interest in Christianity in Great Britain, termed a 'quiet revival'. Citing Phil Knox of the Evangelical Alliance, it outlines key responses for Christians: maintaining hope in God's power (Axiom 01), preparing churches to welcome newcomers, intensifying personal evangelism based on the Gospel of Jesus Christ (Axiom 03), and persistent prayer. This development is relevant to the framework's objective of guiding others to Christ. It underscores the importance for believers to be firmly rooted in the authoritative Word of God, the KJV Bible (Axiom 02), to effectively disciple new believers in accordance with truth.",
